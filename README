SWIG2DOC is an attempt at automatic generation of (HTML) documentation from
SWIG generated code (via XML). In addition Doxygen output will be added, as
well as sidewise injected documenation. For usage:

  ./bin/swig2doc --help

This is part of the Biolib initiative, see http://biolib.open-bio.org/.
Meanwhile it may be of use to more people, so it lives in its own repository.
The code is written in Ruby and depends on libxml2 and libxml-ruby.

This code is published under the same license as SWIG. See
